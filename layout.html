	<p><b>The Eurasian lynx is one of the widest ranging of all cat species. The population fell to a low of around 700 in Europe between 1930 and 1950.</b></p>
<br>
	<h3>Physical Description</h3>
	<p>The Eurasian lynx is the third largest predator in Europe after the brown bear and the wolf, and the largest of the 4 lynx species. It has a short body, long legs and large feet. The ears have a characteristic black tuft at the tip while the paws have sharp retractile claws. Fur is usually grey to red and more or less spotted.</p>
<br>
	<h3>Size</h3>
<p>Weight: 15-28kg</p>
<p>Length: 90-110cm</p>
<p>Height: 60cm</p>
<br>
	<h3>Habitat</h3>
	<p>Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, boreal forest</p>
<br>
	<h3>Biogeographic realm</h3>
	<p>Palearctic</p>
<br>
	<h3>Diet</h3>
	<p>The lynx feeds on small ungulates (hoofed mammals) such as roe deer, and smaller prey like hares where the former is scarce.</p>
<br>
	<h3>Population & Distribution</h3>
	<p>Over the past 50 to 80 years, autochthonous populations of lynx have made an impressive recovery in northern Europe, in the Carpathians and in north-east Europe, west of Russia, contributing to the 10-fold population increase during that period.
	The Eurasian lynx has a wide range, extending across Europe, central Asia (it is distributed across the entire Tibetan plateau), Siberia and East Asia. In Europe, however, there is now limited connectivity between subpopulations.</p>
<br>
	<h3>Threats</h3>
	<P>The main threats to the Eurasian lynx are hunting and habitat loss. Although the population has benefitted from the ban on legal international fur trade, illegal hunting still represents a major threat.</p>
