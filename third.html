    <div class="text"><h1>The Species Declared Extinct</h1>
	<p>It has been calculated that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year. 
	On the basis of this estimation, between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year.
	However recently, scientists at the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity concluded that: Every day, up to 150 species may go extinct. 
	This means as many as 10 percent of species a decade.
	Scientists have recently estimated that there are approximately 8.7 million species on Earth. 
	They believe that 1-2 million of those species are animals. 
	However In all the time humans have been discovering and describing new species, weâ€™ve probably only covered about a fifth of what exists.</p>
	<p>On your left you'll find some of the animals that have gone enxtinct or only few are left.</p></div>
